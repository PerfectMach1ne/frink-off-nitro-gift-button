###### *Formerly and officially "fuck-off-nitro-gift-button", but a toned down vulgarity is both much funnier and more elegant.*
~~Firefox~~Browser plugin that **nukes** the Web Discord Nitro Gift button in the chat bar out of existence.

Made with Firefox in mind, but it should work on any browser after you Google some easily-solvable errors you're probably going to get. Also good luck running that on a non-Developer Edition Firefox (I learned the hard and painful way).

I recommend this Firefox Addon for "installing" it on Firefox editions that don't support functionally disabling `xpinstall.signatures.required`, since I have zero hope for my addon getting verified after my techno grandma struggles and going full Karen on "why did you delete your addon?" feedback on Mozilla Developer page.
